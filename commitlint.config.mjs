 * `footer-leading-blank`, minus the false positives.
 *
 * The stock rule asks conventional-commits-parser where the footer starts, and
 * that parser calls any line shaped like `token: value` a footer — including a
 * body sentence that happens to wrap onto `that: the partition was never
 * created…` or `to: a different schema entirely…`. A check that fails on
 * correct input is a check people learn to wave through, and this rule was
 * added in actana/control after three such commits failed CI with nothing
 * wrong in them.
 *
 * So we find the footer ourselves: the first line that opens with a *known*
 * trailer token (`Refs #39`, `Co-authored-by:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`) starts the
 * footer, and that line must have a blank line above it. Prose is left alone.
 *
 * The trade is a missed report when someone jams an exotic trailer straight
 * onto the body. That is the cheaper failure: the tokens this repo actually
 * uses are all covered, and a false negative costs a blank line while a false
 * positive costs a red required check on a good commit.

// The client half of pairing that never leaves the machine: a key pair, and the
// certificate signing request that proves possession of it.
//
// **Copied from actana/control `packages/sdk/src/core-pairing-csr.ts`** (its
// ADR 0034 D3), unchanged but for prose. ADR 0008 records the copy.
//
// A pairing exchange hands the server a *public* key and gets a certificate back.
// This module is where the other half stays. Everything here runs before a
// socket is opened, and the only value that ever crosses one is
// {@link ClientCsr.csrPem} — the private key is returned to the caller, put
// into the resulting `SearchRegistrationBlob`, and never given to
// `pairing.ts` in a form it could serialise.
//
// **Why a hand-written PKCS#10 encoder rather than a library.** `node:crypto`
// generates key pairs and signs, and it exports a public key as a DER
// `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` — which is the only structure in a CSR that is hard to
// produce. What is left is four fields in a fixed order (RFC 2986 §4), so the
// choice was a ~90-line encoder against a new dependency on the one package in
// this repository whose dependency list is a reviewed artifact
// (`@actana/search` ships to a registry and a private dependency is a broken
// install). The encoder is checked where it counts: the end-to-end suite posts
// what it produces at a real instance, whose `assertSignableCsr` parses it with
// `@peculiar/x509` and verifies the signature before signing. A CSR this file
// got wrong fails that test rather than shipping.
//
// **RSA-2048, matching the server.**
// `@actana/search-shared/pairing/cert-material` refuses anything under 2048
// bits (`MIN_RSA_MODULUS_BITS`), and its own `generateClientCsr` mints exactly
// this. A client that asked for something more exotic would be betting on the
// CA's parser rather than on the algorithm the CA is known to sign.

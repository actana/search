// (its ADR 0034 D7), with the names changed and nothing else: the CA's common
// name is Search's, and `mission-control-panel` becomes the bootstrap client
// this instance issues to itself. Every extension, every algorithm choice and
// the whole CSR-signing half below are Control's. ADR 0008 records the copy.

// Search holds the server cert (presented in the TLS handshake); a paired
// client pins the CA and presents the client cert it was issued. Both are
// signed by the CA, and the handshake is mutual, so a client without a
// certificate reaches nothing but the pairing route (`preauth-gate.ts`).
//
// Uses the `selfsigned` package (pure-JS X.509 over Node WebCrypto) so the
// instance can generate material at start without shelling out to `openssl`.
// `selfsigned` v5 is async-only, so {@link generateCertMaterial} is a Promise.
//
// Server process only — never imported by a browser.

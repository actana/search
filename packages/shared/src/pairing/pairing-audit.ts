// The audit record of every pairing attempt — and of every revocation.
//
// **Copied from actana/control `packages/shared/src/pairing-audit.ts`**
// (ADR 0008). Two changes, both mechanical: the sink writes through
// `@actana/search-shared/log` rather than Control's `log`, and the peer
// constant is spelled for Search's admin listener. The field list, the
// redaction and the outcome vocabulary are unchanged.
//
// Pairing is the one thing on a Search instance that turns knowledge of a short
// code into a certificate this instance's CA vouches for, so "who asked, when, and what did
// they get" is the record an operator needs after the fact — and needs for
// failures as much as for successes, because a run of failures is what an
// attack looks like from here.
//
// The whole of this module is one shape and one rule:
//
//   **What is logged is built from a fixed list of fields, never from the
//   request.** The pairing code, the CSR and any key material are not on that
//   list and cannot be added to it by a caller. A log line is the easiest place
//   in this feature for a secret to end up — it is written on the failure path,
//   it is read by people, and it outlives the request by however long the log
//   is kept — so the redaction is a function with a test rather than a
//   convention with a comment.
//
// The default sink is this repo's `log`, which is where every other Core-side
// event goes; the seam exists so a test can read what was written, and so that
// a later "ship the audit trail somewhere" has one place to attach.

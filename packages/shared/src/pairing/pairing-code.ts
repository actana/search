// The one-time pairing code an operator reads out loud.
//
// **Copied from actana/control `packages/shared/src/pairing-code.ts`** (its ADR
// 0034 D1), byte for byte below this banner. Search is the second user of
// Control's pairing and copies it rather than reimplementing it: a second
// implementation of a pre-auth secret is a second place for it to be wrong.
// ADR 0008 records why the copy exists and what has to stay identical; TASK-015
// lifts it into a package both repositories consume.
//
// `actana-search pair new` mints one of these on the instance and a human carries it to
// the client — that hand-carry is the only manual step left in enrollment, so
// the code is shaped for a voice call and a keyboard, not for a URL. Hence the
// two decisions below.
//
// **The alphabet drops `0`, `O`, `1`, `I` and `L`.** They are the characters a
// human transcribes wrong, and there is nobody downstream to forgive a typo:
// a wrong character burns one of five attempts on a session that dies at the
// cap. Dropping them costs ~3 bits over the eight characters (31^8 ≈ 2^39.6
// against 36^8 ≈ 2^41.3) and buys a code that survives being spoken.
//
// **The draw rejects biased bytes rather than folding them with `%`.** A
// pairing code is a pre-auth secret guarding CSR signing, so the draw has to
// be uniform over the alphabet: `randomBytes(1)[0] % 31` would make the first
// eight letters ~14% likelier than the rest, which is a measurable head start
// for anyone spraying codes at the endpoint.
//
// This file is self-contained and reaches `node:crypto` through an injectable
// port: Search mints codes, tests assert the draw, and neither has to stub a
// global to do it.
//
// These are internals, not wire types. `@actana/search-shared` is private; the
// SDK declares its own shapes for whatever crosses the socket.

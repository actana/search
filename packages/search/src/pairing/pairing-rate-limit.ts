// Rate limiting for Search's one pre-auth endpoint.
//
// **Copied from actana/control `packages/core/src/core-pairing-rate-limit.ts`**
// (ADR 0008). Unchanged but for prose: it is in-process and per-instance in
// both, and both say so.
//
// The per-session attempt cap already bounds guessing *within* a session: five
// wrong codes and that session is dead. It bounds nothing across sessions. An
// attacker who can reach the endpoint can hold a thousand guesses a second
// against every session an operator ever opens, and each one costs them five
// tries against a five-minute window rather than one. That is why ADR 0034
// lists rate limiting as a defence of its own and this module is separate from
// `pairing-session.ts`: the cap is per session and this is per caller, and
// collapsing them would leave the gap between them open.
//
// Two windows, both fixed-size and both counted here:
//
//   • **Per peer** — the address the TCP connection came from. This is the one
//     that stops a single machine spraying codes.
//   • **Global** — every attempt this instance saw, whatever the source. This is
//     the one that survives an attacker with a thousand source addresses, and
//     it is why "just key it by IP" is not the whole answer.
//
// The global window is deliberately generous relative to the per-peer one: it
// is a backstop against a distributed spray, not a limit an operator pairing a
// handful of laptops should ever meet.
//
// The peer map is bounded, and the bound is a claim about the branch an
// attacker drives rather than about the happy path: once the global window is
// saturated every request is refused, so a bound enforced only where a request
// is *allowed* is a bound that stops holding exactly when it is needed. See
// {@link PairingRateLimiter.check}.
//
// No timers, no background sweep: a window is decided by comparing timestamps
// when a request arrives. An instance that is not being paired with does no work
// here at all.
//
// **Two things about the peer this counts, for whoever deploys it.**
//
//   * **It is the socket's address, not a forwarded one.** `req.socket
//     .remoteAddress` is the only address this instance can trust, and an
//     `X-Forwarded-For` is a header the caller writes — reading it would let an
//     attacker pick a fresh "peer" per guess and turn the per-peer window off.
//     So behind a reverse proxy every caller is the proxy, the per-peer window
//     becomes a second global one, and the effective limit for everybody is the
//     lower of the two. **Terminate TLS at this instance** — the client
//     certificate is the identity (ADR 0003) and a proxy that terminates it has
//     already broken more than the rate limit.
//   * **The windows are per process.** Two instances behind one address each
//     allow the full limit, so the real global ceiling is the limit times the
//     number of processes. That is the trade for having no shared store on the
//     pre-auth path: a Redis round trip on the one surface an attacker can
//     reach at will is itself a lever. The per-session cap and the five-minute
//     expiry are what actually bound a guess; this bounds the noise.

   *
   * **A refusal never puts a peer in the map.** That is the memory bound, and
   * it is stated here rather than left to {@link evictIfCrowded} because the

   * and the eviction pass runs on the way out of *every* branch. Either one
   * would hold the bound today; together the invariant does not depend on
